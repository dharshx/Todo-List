#Todo-List

This is a simple web application built with React.js and CSS to help users manage their tasks and to-do lists.

#How to Navigate this Project

The project structure is divided into the following components:

App.js: This is the main component that renders the Todo List.
TodoList.js: This component manages the list of tasks and their status.
TodoForm.js: This component allows users to add new tasks to the list.
Todo.js: This component represents an individual task and its properties.
Why I Built the Project this Way

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in building React.js web applications. I chose to keep the project simple and straightforward to showcase my ability to create modular and reusable components.

#If I Had More Time, I Would Change This

If I had more time, I would implement the following features to improve the application:

1. User authentication and authorization
2. Ability to edit or delete existing tasks
3. Sorting tasks by date or priority
4. Integration with a database for persistent data storage

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!
